# Stock-Analysis

Helping Steve analyze a stock dataset for an opportunity of investment. 

## Overview of the Project
With this project were able to help Steve analyze the relationship of a stock portfolio within 2 different years. Instead for Steve to look for each stock within different lines in the datasets and make calculations, we are able to make a more digestible visual analysis that can be changed depending of the year in a matter of seconds. This can help Steve analyze data faster and have an idea to model future analysis.
