# Stock-Analysis

Helping Steve analyze a stock dataset for an opportunity of investment. 

## Overview of the Project
With this project were able to help Steve analyze the relationship of a stock portfolio within 2 different years. Instead for Steve to look for each stock within different lines in the datasets and make calculations, we are able to make a more digestible visual analysis of the volumes and the returns of stocks that can be changed depending of the year in a matter of seconds. This can help Steve analyze data faster and have an idea to model future analysis. We used the tool of Visual Basic in Excel to manage the data of the given years. Thanks to the written code there can be cleaner sheets of excel, and within a clean box to run the analysis, the model can be executed and the results displayed. ItÂ´s a great tool to manage information and tu run analysis that cna me managed easily by the user.
